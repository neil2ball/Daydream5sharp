# Daydream5sharp

It has been one of my dreams to write a program that will pick the best possible Florida Fantasy 5 numbers. This program brings me much closer to that goal.

I reimagined Daydream 5 from the ground up to create the perfect pick set. Not a single pick is duplicated in the set. Each of the Florida Fantasy 5 numbers are used the same number of times.

Every pick obeys the 2-1-1-1, 1-2-1-1, 1-1-2-1, or 1-1-1-2 groupings from the Geometry of Chance paper and the 5/36 (3-2 or 2-3 odds-evens) lotterycodex.

What results is a program that outputs 252 unique picks using each of the thirty-six numbers 35 times.

I will integrate the algorithm into my Android app later. The primary objective is to use features from the Android app to make this more robust.

For now, I sort everything for proof of concept. It is easier to read and make comparisons.

However, I will perhaps leave an unsorted set later on so that folks who do not intend to play 252 numbers at one time can enjoy a solid approximation of this applicaton's intent.
